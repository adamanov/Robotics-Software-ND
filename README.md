# Robotics-Software-ND
Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree program (RoboND) from Udacity

I share projects of the RoboND I finished. 

For roboticist with Mechanical Engineering background, I believe the [Robotics program](https://www.udacity.com/course/robotics-software-engineer--nd209) is a very good complementary program. Based on my experience with the [Self-Driving Car ND](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013), I found materials to do the projects without paying for the expensive enrollment fees. However, it's still highly recommended to formally enroll the program if you don't familar with the project topics. 

The helpful materials are listed here:
